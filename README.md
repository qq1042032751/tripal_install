# Tripal Rapid Installer

Before installing via the rapid installation process please ensure drush is installed, and the server is setup.    Rapid Installation works with Tripal v3.0 and later.   Please see the [Tripal User's Guide](http://tripal.info/tutorials/v3.x) for full setup instructions.

## Database Setup

Before we can install Tripal we must have a database ready for it.  In the server setup instructions were provided to set up a PostgreSQL database server. Now, we need to create the Drupal database. To do so we must first become the PostgreSQL user.

```
sudo su - postgres
```

Next, create the new 'drupal' user account. This account will not be a "superuser' nor allowed to create new roles, but should be allowed to create a database.

```
createuser -P drupal
```

When requested, enter an appropriate password. Finally, create the new database:

```
createdb drupal -O drupal
```

We no longer need to be the postgres user so exit

```
exit
```

## Tripal Installation
-------------------

Navigate to the directory you want to create the website. For this example it will be /var/www/html (the typical home location for Ubuntu and CentOS)

```
cd /var/www/html
```

Make sure you have write permissions within this directory.  Clone the tripal_install project using the git command and move the contents up one level into the web document directory:

```
  git clone https://github.com/tripal/tripal_install.git
  mv tripal_install/* ./
```

Begin the installation for a generic installation with the following command:
```
drush --include=. tripal-generic-install
```

From this point onward, you will be asked a series of questions in the terminal window.  First you will be asked for the name of the site (this will appear at the top of your site after creation), the site administrator's email address, a username for the administrator to log on, and the password for the administrator:

```
  Name of the site : Tripal
  Admin email for the site : admin@gmail.com
  Name for your admin user on the site : admin
  Password for the admin user, needs to be complex including numbers and characters, example P@55w0rd: P@55w0rd

  These are the site settings provided, please review and confirm they are correct
     Site Name: Tripal
     Site email address: admin@gmail.com
     Administrator username: admin
     Administrator password: P@55w0rd
  Is this information correct? (y/n): y
```

Next, you will be asked for the database information: database name, database  username, database  user password, host, and port.  The database name and user should match what you created in the previous section (i.e. database name = 'drupal' and database user = 'drupal').  The 'host' is the name of the server or its IP address, and the port is a numerical value that PostgreSQL uses for communication.  By default PostgreSQL uses the port 5432.  If a mistake is made you can make corrections as shown in the following screenshot:

```
  Now we need to setup Drupal to connect to the database you want to use. These settings are added to Drupal‘s settings.php file.

  database name: database
  postgres username: drupal
  postgres password: drupal
  host, like localhost or 127.0.0.1: 127.0.01
  port, usually S432: 5432
  This is the database information provided, please review and confirm it is correct:
  Database name: database
  Database username: drupal
  Database user password: drupal
  Database host: 127.0.01
  Database port: 5432
  Is this information correct? (Y/n): n

  Now we need to setup Drupal to connect to the database you want to use. These settings are added to Drupal‘s settings.php file.

  database name: database
  postgres username: drupal
  postgres password: drupal
  host, like localhost or 127.0.0.1: 127.0.0.1
  port, usually S432: 5432
  This is the database information provided, please review and confirm it is correct:
  Database name: database
  Database username: drupal
  Database user password: drupal
  Database host: 127.0.0.1
  Database port: 5432
  Is this information correct? (Y/n): y
```


After site information and database credentials are provided, Drupal will be installed.  You will see this in the terminal:

```

The installation is now finished! Navigate to your new site by entering it's URL in a browser. For this example the URL is: http://localhost/.
